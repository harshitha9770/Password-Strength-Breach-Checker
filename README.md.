# 🔐 Password Strength & Breach Checker

A simple yet powerful **Cyber Security mini project** that:

- ✅ Checks if a password is **strong or weak**
- 🔍 Verifies if the password has appeared in **real-world data breaches**
- 🔧 Uses the `HaveIBeenPwned` API for secure leak detection

---

## 📌 Features

- ✔️ Checks for:
  - Minimum length (8+ characters)
  - Presence of uppercase, lowercase, digits, special characters
- ✔️ Classifies password as **Weak**, **Medium**, or **Strong**
- ✔️ Uses **k-Anonymity** method to securely check password breaches
- ✔️ Easy to use and test in Google Colab

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. You input any password (test or real)
2. The script checks:
   - Password **strength** based on rules
   - Whether it's been **leaked in any data breach**
3. Results are shown with ✅ or ❌

## 🧪 Example

```python
check_password_strength("12345")
check_data_breach("12345")
